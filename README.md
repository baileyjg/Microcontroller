# Microcontroller

In this project, I created components step-by-step to create a simple microcontroller. This involved drawing up finite-state machines (FSM) using the Moore method to plan out how I would design each component. Once the FSMs were finished, I used those to assist me while coding each of the components of the microcontroller. This entire project was programmed using Verilog.
